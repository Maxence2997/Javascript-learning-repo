# Note

1. The difference between **class** and **id** is `id should be unique on the page and class can be used over and over again`.

2. In Javascript, we use camel case, but in html and css, we use `-` to separate words.
   | Javascript | html & css |
   | ------ | ----------- |
   | classImage | class-image |

3. For html `<div></div>` box are just **generic boxes without any meaning at all**. For SEO, it had better to write the appropriate box(e.g. `<form></form>`) to make the html be semantical.

4. CSS Box Model:
   ![enter image description here](/assets/box-model.gif)
    - **Content**: text, images...etc.
    - **Padding**: transparent area around the content inside of the box.
    - **Border**: goes around the padding and the content.
    - **Margin**: space between boxes.
    - **Fill area**: equals to `content area + padding area + border area` and that gets filled with background or background image.
